# Convex-plasticity

The main goal of the project is to propose an efficient and generic implementation which can tackle both classical and softening plasticity models. The implementation will be then extended to the resolution of the local plasticity problem using convex optimization solvers and assess its efficiency compared to standard return mapping algorithms. Finally, softening plasticity will be considered and regularization strategies in order to prevent mesh dependency will be explored. The implementation is based on the next generation FEniCS problem solving environment.
